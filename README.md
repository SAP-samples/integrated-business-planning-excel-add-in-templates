Our sample VBA planning view templates contain ActiveX controls. This means that any VBA chart in templates and favorites created based on our sample VBA planning view templates can only be used if ActiveX controls are enabled. 
Microsoft announced that in Microsoft 365 and Office 2024, the settings for ActiveX controls have changed to be disabled by default. For more information, see the [Microsoft support pages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/activex-controls-are-disabled-by-default-in-microsoft-365-and-office-2024-9cae60f8-478c-42c6-978c-eca072525d64) and

We are removing the VBA-based sample planning view templates containing ActiveX controls, as we do not recommend using them any longer. We plan to provide new VBA-based sample planning view templates including charts that are not using ActiveX controls.
In the meantime, we are recommending to use the TemplateWithoutVBA.xlsx which does not include any chart or wait until we are providing the adjusted version.‚Äù
