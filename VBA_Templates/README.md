ChartVBA_Embedded_FormControls.xlsm‚Äù is the new sample VBA planning view template that uses Form controls instead of ActiveX controls. The buttons, checkboxes, and list boxes that are used to control the VBA chart have been replaced by Form controls. As a consequence, they look slightly different, but they function the same way.
In previous versions of the sample VBA planning view templates, buttons, checkboxes, and list boxes were ActiveX controls. Microsoft announced that in Microsoft 365 and Office 2024, the settings for ActiveX controls have changed to be disabled by default and recommends to disable ActiveX controls unless necessary, see the [Microsoft support pages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/activex-controls-are-disabled-by-default-in-microsoft-365-and-office-2024-9cae60f8-478c-42c6-978c-eca072525d64). Therefore, we have removed the previous versions of the sample VBA templates and replaced them with a new one. We recommend using this version or the one without VBA (TemplateWithoutVBA.xlsx) to create new planning view templates. 
If you want to deactivate ActiveX controls for your users, you need to adjust any existing planning view templates and favorites that have been created based on the former sample VBA templates and upload them with version 2511.2.0 or newer of the Excel add-in. Additionally, make sure that all users have at least version 2511.2.0 of the Excel add-in installed.

We know that adjusting or creating your templates requires effort and the right knowledge, therefore we plan to provide additional help in this regard with version 2602.2.0 of the Excel add-in.
As of now, no ChartVBA_AddIn.xlsm version exists that uses Form controls instead of ActiveX controls. We plan to provide such a version soon.
